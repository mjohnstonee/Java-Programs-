IT205 Intro to Obj Oriented Programming
programmer: Michelle Johnstone
Date: September 5, 2019
Mathematical operators and expressions, order of precedence,
logical expressions, control structures. 

Lecture: 
Math operators * multiplication, / division, + addition, - subtraction, % modulus or remainder of division 
= assignment operator assigns value on RHS to variable on the LHS 


4*3-21/7%8 How is this expression evaluated by a computer? 
Order of precedence 
1st unary operators +,-,  examples: x = -3 
2nd *  / %
3rd + -
4th relational operators 
5th == != equality operators (Relational) 
last assigment operator 

Equal precedence then left to right 
() expressions in parentheses evaluated first

logical expressions: evaluate to true or false 
you are comparing two values using relational operators 

5>3 false 5.98> 3.142 true 

'A' > 'Z' false ASCII is used to represent every character and numbers in the english language.

Remember 'A' is less than 'a' 

how about comparing strings? "Jack" < "Henry" false 
Jack < Jackie true 

arrives based on 

write a program before we look at control structures 

given the number of cents a person has, tell me how many dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and cents it can be converted into 


all expressions are cast ( temporary) to the strongest datatype implicitly 
can explicitly cast to a stronger or weaker datatype: 
dataype( expression or variable) 

the int/int gives you an interger result. any decimal part that results will be truncated 

10/3 results in 3 

10/3.0 is int/double - implcitly cast to strongest datatype 
10.0/3.0 resulting in 3.3333
weakest is char, int, float, double being strongest 
float (10)/ 3 ==10.0/3 ==10.0/3.0  resulting in 3.333
